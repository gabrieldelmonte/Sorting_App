# Results Directory

This folder contains the JSON output files generated by the sorting algorithms benchmark tools.

## Files

Each implementation of the sorting algorithms project generates its own results file:

- `results_cpp.json` - Results from the C++ implementation
- `results_python.json` - Results from the Python implementation  
- `results_java.json` - Results from the Java implementation

## File Format

All result files follow the same JSON structure:

```json
[
  {
    "algorithm": "algorithm_name",
    "runs": 10,
    "times": [0.001, 0.002, ...],
    "average_time": 0.0015,
    "min_time": 0.001,
    "max_time": 0.002,
    "std_deviation": 0.0005
  }
]
```

## Usage

These files are automatically generated when you run the benchmark tools from each language implementation. You can use these JSON files for:

- Comparing performance across different implementations
- Analyzing algorithm performance statistics
- Creating visualizations and reports
- Data analysis and research

The results are saved here regardless of which directory you run the benchmarks from.
